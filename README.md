## LICENSE

kForth-64 for x86_64-GNU/Linux is provided under the terms of the GNU
Affero General Public License (AGPL), v3.0 or later.


## INSTALLATION 

The following packages are required to build and maintain kForth-64 from
its source package, on a GNU/Linux system:

    binutils
    gcc
    gcc-c++
    glibc
    glibc-devel
    libstdc++-devel
    make
    readline
    readline-devel
    patchutils

Some or all of these packages may already be installed on your GNU/Linux
system, but if they are not, you should install them for your GNU/Linux
distribution. GNU C/C++ version 4.0 or later should be used.

To build:

1. Unpack the files if you obtained them as a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file.

2. Change to the `kForth-64-branch/src/` directory, where "branch" is the project
   branch, e.g. `master`, and type `make` to build the executables. A successful
   build results in two executables, `kforth64` and `kforth64-fast`.

3. Move the executables into the search path. It is recommended to move
   the kForth-64 executables to `/usr/local/bin` . You must be root to do this.

4. Specify the default directory in which kforth64 will search for Forth source
   files not found in the current directory. The environment variable `KFORTH_DIR`
   may be set to this directory. For example, under the BASH shell, if you want
   the default directory to be your `~/kForth-64-branch/forth-src/` directory, add the
   following lines to your `.bash_profile` file (or `.profile` on some systems):

           KFORTH_DIR=~/kForth-64-branch/forth-src
           export KFORTH_DIR

## Forth Source Examples

Sample source code files, typically with the extension `.4th`, are
included in the `kForth-64-branch/forth-src/` directory. These files serve as
programming examples for kForth-64, in addition to providing useful
libraries of Forth words and applications written in Forth. Within the
`forth-src/` subdirectory, you will find additional subdirectories containing
different categories of Forth libraries or applications. These include:

`system-test/`     A set of automated tests to validate the Forth system against
                   the Forth-2012 standard

`fsl/`             modules from the Forth Scientific Library, including test code

`games/`           console games written in Forth

`benchmarks/`      simple benchmarks to compare the relative speed of Forth systems


Important system-level files in the `forth-src/` subdirectory include,

* `ans-words.4th`   Forth-94 words provided in source form
* `strings.4th`     String handling library
* `files.4th`       Standard Forth words for file i/o
* `ansi.4th`        ANSI terminal control
* `dump.4th`        Forth `DUMP` utility
* `modules.fs`      A framework for modular programming in Forth
* `serial.4th`      Low-level serial port interface
* `syscalls.4th`    Operating System calls
* `socket.4th`      Sockets interface
* `ttester.4th`     Test harness used by the automated test code
