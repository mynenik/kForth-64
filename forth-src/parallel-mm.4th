\ parallel-mm.4th
\
\ Parallel matrix multiplication on a multi-core machine using the
\ syscalls, fork and mmap.
\
\ Krishna Myneni, 2010-04-17
\
\ Multiply an n x m matrix A with a m x 1 vector B to find the n x 1
\ result. Use one process to multiply the even rows of A with B, and
\ use the child process to multiply the odd rows of A with B.
\
\ Notes:
\
\  0) The syscalls, "fork", "mmap", "munmap", and "waitpid" 
\     are implemented in syscalls.4th.
\
\  1) It is assumed that on a multi-core CPU, the child process is
\     forked by the OS to use a different core. On a 4-core machine,
\     we find this to be true under Linux.
\
\  2) The input matrix A{{ and array B{ are not in shared memory
\     since both processes have access to separate copies of their
\     fixed data, and do not write to these. The computed product
\     data must be in a shared region to allow the main process to
\     obtain the child-computed data. For very large matrices, A{{
\     and B{ can be kept in shared memory as well.
\
\ Revisions:
\   2010-04-17  km  use syscall waitpid to wait for child to terminate
\                   before measuring elapsed time; renamed syscalls386.4th
\                   to syscalls.4th so INCLUDE statement changed accordingly.
\   2015-08-01  km  include modules.fs since syscalls.4th is now a module.
\   2017-05-13  km  updated to use shared memory to communicate child
\                   process calculation to parent. Store single process
\                   and parallel process calculations in separate arrays
\                   for comparison. The code is generalized for an 
\                   arbitrary number of rows for matrix A{{ .
\   2017-05-22  km  updated to use the generic matrix multiplication 
\                   module fsl/extras/mmul.4th; execution speed improved
\                   from previous version by a factor of 5 with 
\                   kforth-fast.
\   2021-05-18  km  replace use of WAITPID with WAITID syscall.
