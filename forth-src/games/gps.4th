\ gps.4th
\
\ A simplified version of the Newell-Simon General Problem Solver,
\ described in:
\
\	 "GPS, A Program That Simulates Human Thought", by
\	 Allen Newell and H. A. Simon
\
\ reprinted in "Computers and Thought", edited by E. A. Feigenbaum 
\ and J. Feldman, 1995, AAAI Press, pp. 279--293.
\
\ The GPS program demonstrates separation of the problem solving 
\ technique from the description of the problem. The implementation
\ given here is essentially that of the Common Lisp example given
\ in 
\
\	"Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming", 
\	Peter Norvig, 1992, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, pp. 109--120.
