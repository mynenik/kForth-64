\ Notes:
\
\   1. The input source may be one of the audio capture
\      sources (card, device) listed by the command
\
\        arecord -l
\
\      The program currently does not determine this
\      information by itself and the card/device must
\      be set manually. The data format, number of
\      audio channels, and sampling rate must also be
\      specified for the input source. See examples
\      of input source specs in this code -- the default
\      source here is an external USB audio digitizer
\      (Scarlett Solo). Example settings are also given
\      for ordinary sound card/chipset line input.
\
\   2. This software supports a two-button hardware interface
\      via the serial port. See rs232-switch.4th and
\      rs232-switch-test.4th. Set the value of SW_PORT to
\      the appropriate value of the serial port id for your
\      system.
